    "Now that we've learned the basics of working with XML and JSON files, the next step it to work with a real API. In this lesson, you'll go through the process of signing up for an account, creating an application (sometimes called an \"app\"), adding your API key, querying an API and saving and transforming the results. Don't worry if you don't know what most of that means - you will by the end of the lesson!\n",

    "\n",
    "###  Creating a Developer Account\n",
    "When you want to call an API, it is often necessary to create some kind of account with the organization that is providing the API. It allows them to know what person (or at least what email address) is associated with all of the queries you run, allowing them to shut down your access to the API if your usage of their API doesn't follow their guidelines (excessive use, unacceptable use, etc).\n",

    "### Register Your App\n",
    "The next step that many API providers ask you to do is to \"register your app\". Why do they do that? Well, there isn't always a 1:1 correspondence between developers and applications. Imagine that after this course you decide to become a professional software developer, building web apps for various clients. You would want to use a different set of credentials for each of the applications that you build so if one of your clients started misusing the API your entire developer account wouldn't get suspended - just their app.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create your new App:\n",
    "- Click on your email address in the top right - a drop down menu should appear\n",

    "## Calling the API\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up, we need to go read some docs. Click on the \"APIs\" link at the top of the NY Times developer website to go [here](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis). Click on the \"Article Search API\" link to go [here](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "It explains that you need to make a call that looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?q=election&api-key=yourkey`\n",
    "\n",
    "Where you would replace election with whatever search term you wanted, and the `yourkey` at the end with the API key you just got for your app. \n",
    "\n",
    "Give it a try! Open a new tab in your browser, copy the whole URL string above, paste it into the new browser tab and hit return. You should get the following message returned:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"fault\": {\n",

Go back to the tab with your app information in *(or go [here](https://developer.nytimes.com/my-apps) if you navigated away from that)*, click on your app, and where it says \"API Keys\" and then \"Key\", mouse over the key, then click on the \"copy to clipboard\" link that pops up when you mouse over it.\n",

    "### Automating the API Call\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that we were able to test this API call in the browser. But now we really need to figure out how to do this from Python. That way whether we want to run hundreds of calls a day or simply run a query every week or two, we can automate the process of asking for, receiving, processing and acting on the information - in whatever way we want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step, then, is to figure out how to call the API from Python, but first, lets just define a few terms...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Terms\n",
    "When we interact with an API, we talk about making **calls** *(hey, do you have that script that **calls** the Twilio API to send out a text every time someone signs up for our newsletter?)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calls are most often sent using a **protocol** (a way of sending information from one computer to another) called **HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**. Yes - that's right - the http that you see most times you see a website address - e.g. [http://www.google.com](http://www.google.com). Strictly speaking these days, most of the calls we send actually use **HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (https)**, but that's pretty similar to http - it just has a little more back and forth between the two computers to ensure all of the information is encrypted between them, making it harder for someone else to pretend to be the website you're trying to connect to.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to send the call somewhere - it needs an adddress. It's like making a phone call - you need to know someone's number to call them. On the internet, the actual location your call should be routed to is based on an **IP *(Internet Protocol)* address**. In practice though, we usually use a **Domain Name** that gets looked up by a **Domain Name Server** to find the right IP address. Think of it as a global address book that allows you to look up where you want to go using a human readable name like google.com instead of a set of numbers like 172.217.4.142.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've decided on the domain name, you also need to enter the appropriate path to the script you want to access. It's the part of the URL after the domain name. In this case it is `svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then finally, for some APIs there is a **query string** which is anything after a `?` towards the end of the URL. In this case it's the `q=election&api-key=yourkey`. It is a way of passing a set of variables in the URL, with an `&` between each key/value pair, so in this example we're setting a variable called `q` to `election` and a variable called `api-key` to `yourkey`. These are variables used by the remote server to better respond to your API call.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call an API you make a **request**. Assuming the server you are connecting to is working and you're not blocked, it will then typically send you a **response**. That's sometimes called the **request/response cycle**. With some API's you need to make an initial request to validate that you are someone the server is willing to talk to, with others (like the NY Times one we're starting with), you just have to pass a unique identifier (your API Key) in each call to let the server know who you are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another pair of terms that might come up are **serialization** and **deserialization**. In Python we store information in variables of various types (dicts, lists, sets, strings, etc). When we want to save that information outside of our running program, we often need to *serialize* the information to turn it into a string that can be stored in a file or sent to a web server. For a simple data type like a string, serialization is trivial *(there's nothing to do - it is already a string)*. For a numeric type, it needs to be transformed into a string so `12` becomes `\"12\"`. For something like a list or a dictionary, it has to follow some agreed serialization process to save it in a way that other programs will be able to re-import it successfully. For example, one way of serializing data is to save it to JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about *deserialization*, it's the reverse process. It's the process of ingesting a string from a file or a web request and turning it back into native Python variables like lists and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Requests Library\n",
    "In Python, there is a library called [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) which makes it easy to interact with APIs. Try running the following code ***(substituting your key for the \"your_key_here\" value in the third line of code)***."
